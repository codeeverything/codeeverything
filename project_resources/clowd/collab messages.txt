User hits key
this stores the keystroke in a userkeybuffer. we also start a timer set for a defined delay
if another keystroke occurs we reset the delay and wait the time again adding the new key press to the buffer, unless we hit a buffer size, or if the action that would occur is different to the previous action (for example you may be inserting characters and then hit delete, a removal of characters)
if nothing else is pressed then we fire the timer which sends the buffer to the server to be processed

The Buffer
buffer = {
	action: insert|delete,
	keybuffer: [
		{x: Z, y: Y, char: C}
	]
}
